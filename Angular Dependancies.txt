DATABASE queries for the display's in angular:(Just actor and movie for the moment)

I don't know if PK OR fk should be displayed maybe a link or a button to the director when i can this bit working properly. 

**Movie to display in ViewMovies Component**
SELECT MOVIE_TITLE,MOVIE_DESC,MOVIE_IMG,TRAILER,YEAROFRELEASE from Movie;

#Example query for insert, (I put captain marvel poster and trailer are in the posters_and_trailers folder).
INSERT INTO MOVIE(MOVIE_ID,MOVIE_TITLE,MOVIE_DESC,MOVIE_IMG,TRAILER,YEAROFRELEASE,DIRECTOR_ID VALUES '6','Captain Marvel','Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races.',
LOAD_FILE(C:/posters_and_trailers/captainMarvel.jpg),LOAD_FILE("C:/posters_and_trailers/captain-marvel-trailer.mp4"),'2019',7);

**Actor to display in ViewActor Component** I will adjust the angular bit to include image for actor(I don't think there is any need to display PK)
**I added in an actor image field for this query here,I put the actors images in the Actors folder in project**
SELECT FIRST_NAME,SURNAME,ACTOR_IMG FROM ACTOR;

INSERT INTO ACTOR (ACTOR_ID,FIRST_NAME,SURNAME,ACTOR_IMG) VALUES ('34','Brie','Larson',LOAD_FILE("C:/actors/brielarson.jpg));
INSERT INTO ACTOR (ACTOR_ID,FIRST_NAME,SURNAME,ACTOR_IMG) VALUES ('35','Samuel','L Jackson',LOAD_FILE("C:/actors/samuelljackson.jpg));
