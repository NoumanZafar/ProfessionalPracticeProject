I was doing deletes trying many many different ways with the headers/http headers but I am getting CORS errors for both movies and actors.
This is the error and no matter what I try it is the same error. I have tried http.delete/ http.post and am still getting this error for both.

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/movies/delete/undefined' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
