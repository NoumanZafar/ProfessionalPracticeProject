Writes to movies working but images are not being displayed when being read in view movies component,I checked mine and I can find anything.
the trailers are fine,i need to sort that display out.

I checked console in developer mode and it is a part of the json, being added. 
There is a screenshot in this folder here of that(Console Screenshot).

Would you mind whenever you get a chance to just do backend bits for director view and add. Sorry to nag,
Cheers!
