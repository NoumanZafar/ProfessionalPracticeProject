Writes to movies working but images are not being displayed when being read in view movies component,I checked mine and I can find anything.
the trailers are fine,i need to sort that display out.

I checked console in developer mode and it is a part of the json, being added. 
There is a screenshot in this folder here of that(Console Screenshot).

Would you mind whenever you get a chance to just do backend bits for director view and add. Sorry to nag,
Cheers!


Update on th Problem

There is no problem in the backend or view (client side). But there is a problem in movie.service.ts (addMovie method) where both
movieImage and movieTrailer are set to the same string (base64textString). and in html file (add.component.html) movieImage and 
movieTrailer inputs are calling the same method but set the value to a single variable (base64textString). 
Easient way to fix this problem is to duplicate the two methods where image or trailer are converted to Base64 string and in
html file call the seperate methods.
